Abstract: Power grid digitalization introduces new vulnerabilities and cyber security threats. The impact of cyber attacks on power system stability is a topic of growing concern, which is yet to be comprehensively analyzed. Traditional power system stability analysis is based on the impact of non-malicious small, and large physical disturbances. However, cyber attacks introduce a new dimension to power system stability, in which malicious cyber actors can selectively target critical systems and applications and cause severe stability issues. Hence, in this work, the traditional disturbances considered in power system stability classification are expanded from physical to cyber-physical disturbances caused by cyber attacks. Based on a thorough state-of-the-art, an analysis of how cyber attacks can translate into physical disturbances affecting the traditional power system stability categories is performed. The system stability analysis is expanded by mapping the power system stability categories with the defined cyber-physical attack types. The findings of this work showcase the importance of cyber security for power system stability.
